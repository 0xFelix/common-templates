A set of OpenShift Templates to create KubeVirt VMs.

# Overview

All VMs are provided as [OpenShift templates](https://docs.okd.io/latest/dev_guide/templates.html).
These templates can be used straight forward with OpenShift itself, or they
can be transformed into regular objects for use with Kubernetes.

Every template consists of two objects:

1. A VirtualMachineInstancePreset definition for the specific guest, this is
   comparable to a "flavor"
2. A VirtualMachine definition which can be used to launch the guest, if a disk
   image is available (see below)

The presets allow to keep all the guest specific machine configuration in a
single place. This configuration is applied to the VMs once they are started.

# Templates

| Template | Description | |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 (win2k12r2) | For this and other versions | [Source](templates/win2k12r2.yaml) |
| Fedora 28 | For this and other versions | [Source](templates/fedora28.yaml) |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 | For this and other versions | [Source](templates/rhel7.5.yaml) |
| Ubuntu | | TBD |
| OpenSuse | | TBD |

# How to create Virtual Machines

Every template (if not noted otherwise) has two parameters:

1. `NAME`: The name of the VM to be created
1. `PVCNAME`: The name of the PVC which holds the disk image to be run

Manually transforming a tempalte into a list of objects can be done by using
[`oc`](https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases) - the OpenShift client tool:

```bash
oc process --local \
  -o yaml \
  -f "templates/$TEMPLATE_NAME" \
  NAME=the-vmname \
  PVCNAME=the-pvcname
```

If the object shsall be created right away then the output can be piped to
`kubectl`:

```bash
oc process â€¦ | kubectl apply -f -
```
